# Multivariate-Statistical-Methods
I applied Principal Component Analysis, Factor Analysis to explain most of the variation in the data taking a minimum number of variables from the data. Then I applied Canonical Correlation to measure the highest correlation between two sets of variables.  

The code and results are shown [here](/Codes_Multivariate_Project.md).
